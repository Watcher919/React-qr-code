## [4.0.1] - 2024-08-28

### Fixed
- Corrected issue with loading types in Typescript when configured with `"moduleResolution": "Bundler"` or `"module": "ESNext"`. (#368)


## [4.0.0] - 2024-08-27

### Added

- Added proper support for `ref`, enabling direct access for underlying `canvas` or `svg` nodes. This also resulted in much more accurate type defitions. (#202)
- Added support for `marginSize` prop, replacing the now deprecated `includeMargin`. This enables margins of any value, not just `0` or `4`. (#281)
- Added Support for Setting Image Opacity via `imageSettings.opacity` (#292)
- Added `minVersion` prop to give better control over QR Code generated (#323)
- Added support for specifying `cross-origin` for embedded images via `imageSettings.crossOrigin`. (#324)

### Changed

- Improved accessibility for `QRCodeSVG` by rendering a `<title>` node instead of setting a `title` attribute. (#284)
- Improved accessibility with explicit `role` set on rendered SVG and Canvas. (#321)
- Improved documentation (#358)
- Used better types in TypeScript for ErrorCorrectionLevel, resulting in better developer experience. (#291)

### Deprecated

- The `includeMargin` prop has been deprecated in favor of `marginSize`. (#281)

### Removed

- Removed default export which was deprecated in v3. (#208)
- Remove explicit `style` prop. This still works identically as it was passed through and the type definitions are unaffected as they were improved via the `ref` changes (#357)

### Fixed

- Improved support for dual publishing of ESM/CJS modules for better compatibility with tools. (#301)
- Set explicit display names for improved debugging experience. (#304)
- Improved SVG compatibility by using `href` in place of `xlink:href` for embedded images. (#336)
- Mitigated warnings when using QRCodeSVG in server components (#352)


## [3.1.0] - 2022-06-25
